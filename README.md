# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

In the realm of machine learning, one of the most intriguing challenges is predicting house prices. Although I personally have not embarked on a house-hunting journey, I am intrigued by the complexity of factors that influence these prices.

To delve into this, I am developing a machine learning model trained on a dataset specifically designed for house price prediction. This model aims to provide reliable estimates, which could be a valuable tool for those in the real estate market.

For this task, I have chosen to implement four distinct regression models:

  - *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*
  - *Random Forest Regressor*
  - *Linear Regressor*
  - *Cat Boost Regressor*
These models were selected due to their proven effectiveness in handling different types of data patterns and their robust performance in regression tasks.

To measure the accuracy of these models, I will be using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric. This will offer a clear indication of how close the predictions are to the actual prices, thereby ensuring the reliability of our model.
